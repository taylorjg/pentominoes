# TODO

* ~~Create basic structure~~
* ~~Find first solution~~
* ~~Draw first solution~~
* ~~Deploy to Heroku~~
* ~~Draw all solutions as they are found~~
* ~~Fix bug regarding the building of the matrix~~
  * ~~Should have 1568 rows leading to 65 solutions~~
  * ~~Need to consider transpositions~~
    * ~~See https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs/polyominoes.w~~
* ~~Still getting wrong number of solutions (520 instead of 65!)~~
  * ~~Ignore solutions that are merely rotations or transpositions of other solutions~~
* ~~Do the solving using a web worker~~
* Display the solutions in a grid
  * Make the grid responsive
* Improve rendering of solutions
  * Rounded corners
  * Borders
